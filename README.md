```lrc
[00:00.70] The end of the night
[00:10.38] We should say goodbye
[00:14.25] But we carry on
[00:17.73] While everyone's gone
[00:22.50] Never felt like this before
[00:26.27] Are we friends or are we more
[00:30.61] As I'm walking towards the door
[00:34.51] I'm not sure
[00:37.78] But baby if you say you want me to stay
[00:43.38] I'll change my mind
[00:46.93] 'Cause I don't wanna know I'm walking away
[00:51.53] If you'll be mine
[00:55.39] Won't go, won't go
[01:02.32] So baby if you say you want me to stay
[01:09.40] Stay for the night
[01:13.14] I'll change my mind
[01:15.19] Lean in when you laugh
[01:20.40] We take photographs
[01:24.54] There's no music on
[01:27.65] But we dance along
[01:32.90] Never felt like this before
[01:36.48] Are we friends or are we more
[01:40.96] As I'm walking towards the door
[01:44.93] I'm not sure
[01:48.61] But baby if you say you want me to stay
[01:53.23] I'll change my mind
[01:56.99] 'Cause I don't wanna know I'm walking away
[02:01.40] If you'll be mine
[02:05.02] Won't go, won't go
[02:13.48] So baby if you say you want me to stay
[02:18.45] Stay for the night
[02:21.50] I'll change my mind
[02:26.52] I'll change my mind
[02:33.81] Baby if you say you want me to stay
[02:45.37] I'll change my mind
[02:47.80] But baby if you say you want me to stay
[02:52.81] I'll change my mind
[02:56.26] 'Cause I don't wanna know I'm walking away
[03:00.91] If you'll be mine
[03:05.36] Won't go, won't go
[03:13.60] So baby if you say you want me to stay
[03:18.03] Stay for the night
[03:21.58] I'll change my mind
