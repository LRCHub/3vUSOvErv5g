Ooh baby, can I change my mind?
Can I change my mind?

Oh, she didn't bat an eye
As I packed my bags to leave
I thought that she would start to cry
Or sit around this room and grieve

Oh, but the girl, she fooled me this time
She acted like I was the last thing on her mind
I would like to start all over again

Oh, baby, can I change my mind?
I just wanna change my mind
Baby, let me change my mind

As I took those steps
Right toward that open door
Knowing all the time
Lord, I just did not want to go

Oh, but she didn't give me no sign
Nothing that would make me change my mind
I would like to start all over again

No, baby, baby, can I change my mind?
I just wanna change my mind
Oh baby, can I change my mind?

Oh, I played my games so many times before
People, let me tell you all
Every time I never, never reached the door

Oh, but the wind it howls tonight
Looking back, my baby nowhere in sight
I would like to start all over again

Oh, baby, baby, can I change my mind?
I just wanna change my mind
I just wanna change my mind

Baby, let me change my mind
I just wanna change my mind
Baby, let me change my mind
I just wanna change my mind
