I bet you guessed where I was some time ago
And I bet that you really didn't know
I don't need you
I don't want you
But I might change my mind

We could take off for Paris on a cruise
You and me could make front page news
But it don't mean nothing
Don't mean a thing
Cause I might change my mind

There was a time when it was good
We laughed and danced all over the neighborhood
You'd take my hand
I apologize
But I just might change my mind

I got to know if I've been or gone
Need to know if it's worth hangin' on
Time is mine
What's mine is yours
And I just might change my mind
I just might change my mind
I just might change my mind
